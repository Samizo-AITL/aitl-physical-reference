# Design Intent

This board provides a minimal physical reference that converts
abstract control logic into observable voltage and current behavior.

## Purpose
- Anchor logical "ON/OFF" into real current flow
- Provide a physical probe point for control systems
- Serve as the lowest-level reference in AITL architecture

## Relation to AITL
- Logical decision → voltage application
- Control abstraction → copper behavior
- Simulation → measurable physics
