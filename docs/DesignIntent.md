description: "A minimal physical reference PCB that grounds abstract control logic into real voltage, current, and copper."

# 🧠 Design Intent

This board provides a **minimal physical reference** that converts  
**abstract control logic** into **observable voltage and current behavior**.

It exists to define the **first physical boundary**  
where logic becomes electricity.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- 🔌 Anchor logical **ON / OFF** decisions into **real current flow**
- 📍 Provide a **probe-able physical observation point** for control systems
- 🧱 Serve as the **lowest-level physical reference** within the **AITL architecture**

This board intentionally avoids functionality  
and focuses on **grounding**.

---

## 🔗 Relation to AITL

Within **AITL (Architecture for Integrated Technology Logic)**,  
this board represents the **Physical Truth Layer**.

- 🧠 **Logical decision** → 🔌 **Voltage application**
- 🎛 **Control abstraction** → 🟠 **Copper behavior**
- 🧪 **Simulation** → 📏 **Measurable physics**

No firmware.  
No interpretation.  
Only what can be **powered, probed, and measured**.

Design intent is preserved by **what is omitted**  
as much as by what is included.
