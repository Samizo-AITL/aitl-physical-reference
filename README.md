# aitl-physical-reference

This repository provides a **minimal physical reference PCB**  
that anchors abstract control and logic concepts into **real voltage, current, and copper**.

It is intentionally **small, generic, and architecture-agnostic**,  
focusing on **observability, physical constraints, and manufacturability** rather than functionality.

## Purpose

The purpose of this board is **not control**, but **grounding**.

- Fix abstract logic into **measurable V–I behavior**
- Provide a **visible and probe-able physical endpoint**
- Act as a **lowest-level physical reference**, reusable across systems

This board can be *used by* higher-level architectures  
(control logic, supervisory layers, AI reasoning),  
but it **does not depend on them**.

---

## What This Is

This repository contains a **reference PCB**, not a product.

The board includes only elements required to expose
the relationship between logic and physics:

- **LED** — observable output state  
- **Resistor** — physical constraint (current limitation)  
- **Switch** — discrete physical event input  
- **Test Point** — voltage / current measurement access  
- **Board outline (Edge.Cuts)** — explicit physical boundary  

Nothing more.

---

## What This Is NOT

- ❌ Not a full controller  
- ❌ Not MCU-centric  
- ❌ Not performance-optimized  
- ❌ Not tied to any single architecture or framework  
- ❌ Not a demo board for features  

This repository intentionally avoids *solutions* and focuses on *reference*.

## Architecture Mapping (Conceptual → Physical)

| Conceptual Role | Physical Element |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Output state    | LED              |
| Constraint      | Resistor         |
| Event input     | Switch           |
| Observation     | Test point       |
| Boundary        | PCB outline      |

This mapping is the **core value** of the project.

## Build & Assembly Flow

To physically build and use this reference board:

1. Review **`bom/bom.csv`** and prepare components  
2. Manufacture PCB using KiCad data in `hardware/kicad/`  
3. Assemble components following **`docs/Assembly.md`**  
4. Apply +5V power and observe LED behavior  
5. Verify voltage/current using **`docs/TestProcedure.md`**

This flow is intentionally simple and repeatable.

---

## Verification & Measurement

This board is designed to be **measured**, not just powered.

Typical checks:
- LED ON/OFF state
- Forward voltage at test point
- Current limited by resistor
- Boundary defined by board outline

These checks validate the **logic → physics transition**.

---

## Toolchain

- **CAD**: KiCad  
- **Design style**: Minimal, readable, single-layer preferred  
- **Outputs**: Standard manufacturable Gerber data  

The design favors **clarity over density**.

---

## Usage Context

This physical reference can be used in:

- Control systems
- Supervisory logic
- Educational hardware
- Logic-to-physical architecture studies
- AITL-based discussions and validation

It acts as a **ground truth layer**, not a controller.

---

## Status

- **v0** — Minimal physical reference  
  - LED  
  - Resistor  
  - Switch  
  - Test point  

Future revisions may extend observability,
but will preserve minimalism.

---

## Roadmap

- v0: Passive physical reference (LED / R / SW / TP)
- v1: MCU boundary reference (GPIO ↔ Physical)
- v2: Control-capable reference (PID / FSM execution)
